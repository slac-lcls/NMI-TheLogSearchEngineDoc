<h1> The LCLS server logs search engine 
<img class="workInProgress" src="./pics/work-in-progress-2.png">
</h1> 
<hr>



<p>
<b>Objective</b>. We want to search into our servers log files as fast and easily as possible.  
</p>

<h2> Recent changes. From Elasticsearch to Solr  </h2> 
<hr>

<p>
Between <b>Nov/Dec 2019</b> I re-implemented our search engine stack in Solr, in all parallel to the one already running in Elasticsearch. As of today <b>12-Dic-2019</b> the port is complete and the Solr implementation is working. In a few weeks, if all goes well, Elasticsearch will be removed from our servers. Elasticsearch is the only part of ELK which is not bad, but its importance on the stack is diminishing. </p>




<h3> Motivations for a change. </h3>

</table> 

<p>
On date <b>17-Oct-2019</b> I was at the San Jose 'Elastic{ON}' event. There I convinced my self definitely I did not want to stay with ELK and and change as soon as possible. The conference was all about user interfaces, there was not a single word about algorithms, no one explanation on the inner working on the system. The tacit assumption was that 'it is good for all cases', which is not true. Questions were not welcome and not answered, if not in private. 
</p>

<p>
The strategy of Elasti.co company is to get new users with a product which is apparently easy to use. Then,  once you will start to load it you will get in trouble. At that moment you will need to call them and pay.
</p>


<h2> Ante Hoc. How the problem was managed so far. </h2>
<hr>

<p>
Before this project started the way to search into log files was this:
<ol>
<li> Log into <span class="machine">psmetric01</span>, typically via <span class="cmd">ssh</span> or <span class="cmd">nomachine</span>.

<li> Go to the directory <span class="path">/u2/logs</span> where the logs are collected. Each directory here corresponds to a machine name, so there is <span class="machine">psmetric01</span> itself then all the others: <span class="machine">psana101</span>, <span class="machine">psana102</span>, <span class="machine">psana103</span>, ... , etc.

<li> Now, you need to know the machine you are interesed in and the logfile name you think will be relevant. For example, if I want to look for general error messages in <span class="machine">psmetric01</span> I visit the file <span class="path">psmetric01/messages</span>. If I am interested in who logged in I would probably visit <span class="path"> psmetric01/secure </span>.

</ol>
</p>

There are already a few issues with this saerch method:
<ol>
<li> Log files get rotated, you must be ready to study single log files and all their rotated relatives. So for example, you may need to visit <span class="path">psmetric01/secure</span> but also <span class="path">secure-YYYYM1D1.gz</span>, <span class="path">secure-YYYYM2D2</span> ... etc. 

<li> You must be an expert to search the logs, indeed, you need to know <i>a priori</i> the server name and the exact filename where you neet do loook at. So, you must know from the beginning where the problem is, which most often is not the case. 

<li> If you don't know well where to look at, you can still follow the way of whishful fishing with <span class="cmd">grep</span> and see what happens. It goes without saying that this is really problematic because files rotate and there will be issues in sorting out the results. For exampe, this is a naive search of my usernae on all the non-rotated logs 

<div class="cmd withOutput">grep -r 'nmingott' * | head -n 3</div>
<div class="output">psana101/cron-20181224:Dec 16 03:45:01 psana101 CROND[16517]: (nmingott) CMD (export CRON_RUN="true"; /reg/neh/home/nmingott/cronScripts/thisMachineStatusToElastic.rb)
psana101/cron-20181224:Dec 16 03:46:11 psana101 crontab[16648]: (root) LIST (nmingott)
psana101/cron-20181224:Dec 16 03:50:01 psana101 CROND[16964]: (nmingott) CMD (export CRON_RUN="true"; /reg/neh/home/nmingott/cronScripts/thisMachineStatusToElastic.rb)</div>

<div class="cmd withOutput">grep -r 'nmingott' * | tail -n 3</div>
<div class="output">psmetric04/secure.duplicate:Feb  5 15:45:16 psmetric04 sudo: pam_unix(sudo:session): session opened for user root by nmingott(uid=0)
psmetric04/secure.duplicate:Feb  5 15:48:17 psmetric04 sudo: nmingott : TTY=pts/3 ; PWD=/reg/neh/home5/nmingott/scripts/systemTap ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/stap snoop-syscall-open
psmetric04/secure.duplicate:Feb  5 15:48:17 psmetric04 sudo: pam_unix(sudo:session): session opened for user root by nmingott(uid=0)</div>

<p>
Considering today is 23 May 2019, and I just logged into <span class="machine">psmetric01</span> to run these commands, the output is far from satisfactory, the most recent result is from February ! 
</p>

<p>
It goes without saying that the search can be made much more complex and precise. Maybe we could write also a little script just to perform a specific search. But that would require time and thinking. There will be the problem of documenting the script, how to use it, where to store it and, last but not least, to remember it exists. The system we implemented hopefully will not require neither of them and it will be very flexible.
</p>
</ol>

<h2> Post Hoc. How do we search now </h2>
<hr>

<h3>Method 1. From the shell</h3>

<ol>
<li> I log into <span class="machine">psmetric01</span> 
<li> Then I look for my login name 'nmingott': 
<div class="cmd withOutput">$> elastico nmingott | tail -n 5</div>
<div class="output">May 23 14:19:42 psmetric01 sshd[2541]: Authorized to nmingott, krb5 principal nmingott@SLAC.STANFORD.EDU (ssh_gssapi_krb5_cmdok)
May 23 14:19:42 psmetric01 systemd-logind: New session 12268 of user nmingott.
May 23 14:19:42 psmetric01 systemd: Created slice User Slice of nmingott.
May 23 14:19:42 psmetric01 sshd[2541]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user nmingott by (uid=0)
May 23 14:19:42 psmetric01 systemd: Started Session 12268 of user nmingott.</div>
<p>
</p>
</ol>

<p> A few things are worth remarking:
<ol>
<li> In <span class="cmd">elastico</span> output I can see my own last, just performed, login into <span class="machine">psmetric01</span>, that is good.

<li> <span class="cmd">elastico</span> returns by default with the most recent log lines produced. 

<li> The log results are by default sorted in time. The maximum time precision currently in the logs is the <i>second</i>.
<li> The operation is expected to be fast, by default the search should complete in less than 1-2 seconds.
</ol>
</p>

The program <span class="cmd">elastico</span> is documented <a href="https://slac-lcls.github.io/elastico/">here</a>. 

<h3>Method 2. From the web</h3>

There are currently two ways to do it. We are using non of them at the moment. 

<ul>
<li> You could use <b>Kibana</b>. Whilst this is a very flexible tool  and sometimes it can save time, it also very easy to get lost there. The queries it does by default are not specific for our use-case. Moreover, in an effort to unify the monitoring tools we ddecided to use as much as possible <b>Grafana</b>. 

<li> I developed a Grafana plugin called <b>Elastigraph</b>, to perform Elasticsearch queries from Grafana. The queries it runs are very specific to our problem, the user does not need to know JSON stuff. On the other side, both Wilko and I, consider the shell tool <b>Elastico</b> much more practical and powerful, so, over time, Elastigraph was left behind. 

</ul>

<h2> How does our 'Log ElasticStack' works  </h2>

<p>
<b>Definition.</b> In this context I refer to our <b>Log Elastic Stack</b> as the set of all programs that permit us to store, analized and retrive log lines to/from Elasticsearch. It is the full software ecosistem running around Elasticsearch and solving our log problem.
</p>

<p>
The central piece of software is <b>Elasticsearch</b> which is an Information Retrival System. We can think of it in general term as a Database. We store log lines into it and then we ask it to look for them in a later moment.
</p>

<p>
My source of <b>documentation</b> about Elasticsearch was the book "Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide, 1st ed, O'Reilly2015.". This software evolves fast, also its API does, so one must constantly guard against outdated qeury. This is an issue, indeed to automatize anything I need a stable API. When the API changes my programs will brake.  A good point is that a most updated version of the book is available online under the name <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html">"Elasticsearch Reference"</a> and (it is?) updated regularly? 
</p>

<p>
Elasticsearch is a shell around <b>Lucene</b>, which is a very succesful Java information Retrival library used in many software. So, that hard core work is performed by Lucene. ....

<h2> How are logs collected to <span class="machine">psmetric01</span> ? </h2>

<b>TODO</b>. talk a bit about syslogd and its configuration.

<h2> Check that the system is working </h2>

<h3> Check Elasticsearch is on and reachable</h3> 

<p>
<b>Short Way</b>. Ask Elasticsearch something and see if it answers. <span class="cmd">ssh</span> to 
<span class="machine">psmetric01</span> and from there throw it this query:
<div class="cmd withOutput">
</div>
</p>

<ol>
<li> <span class="cmd">ssh</span> to <span class="machine">psmetric01</span>, from there check you can see Elasticsearch listening.
<div class="cmd withOutput"> $> nmap -p 9200 psmetric04</div>
<div class="output">...........................
PORT     STATE SERVICE
3000/tcp open  ppp
...........................
</div>
<li> 

</ol>


<h2> Important Maintenance </h2>

<ul>
<li> When you add a new machine to send its log to <span class="machine">psmetric01</span> you must <b>reboot</b> LCLSlogBeat service to make it update his list of known machines. 
<div class="cmd"> $> ssh psmetric01 </div>
<div class="cmd"> $> systemctl  </div>

<li> From time to time check that there is disk space available in <span class="machine">psmetric04</span>. Indeed Elasticsearch is storing continuously data, sooner or later it will eat all of the disk space. 

<li> From time to time older logs should be removed from Elasticsearch memory. 
<b>TODOxNico</b> prepare a script line for this. <b>CAVEATxNico</b> there can be a problem, remember that logfiles year is 'guessed' from the log parser. 

</ul>


<h2> Elasticsearch configuration file </h2>

<h2> Grafana configuration file ?</h2>
